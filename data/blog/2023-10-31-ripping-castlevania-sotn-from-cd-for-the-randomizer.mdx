Fans of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and of video game randomizers in general, will probably know about the
[SOTN randomizer](https://sotn.io/). I was eager to try it, but I ran into a blocker.

I have the game (specifically, the Greatest Hits edition) on CD, and I even ripped a .iso of it long, long ago to use with Bleem! and later [ePSXe](https://www.epsxe.com/). The image worked fine with the emulators, and I've been using it for over 20 years now.

But, when I tried to use the image with the randomizer, it didn't work. The CRC32 didn't match the one on [Redump](http://redump.org/disc/3379/), so the randomizer didn't recognize it as a vanilla .iso.

So, how exactly does one rip the CD to use with the randomizer?

### AnyBurn and ImgBurn: Didn't work 

Both of these can only create a single .bin image. The CRC32 doesn't match redump. (Or each otherâ€¦) 

So, onto the next attempt.

### MPF / DiscImageCreator: Requires specific models of CD drive 

This is the "official" way to dump CDs for redump, according to [the Redump documentation](http://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=Disc_Dumping_Guide_(MPF) ). 

This only works with a few specific CD drive models. It errored when I tried it with mine. [The list of supported models is here](http://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=DiscImageCreator:_Optical_Disc_Drive_Compatibility).

### RetroArch

Next, I tried ripping the disc using RetroArch (for reference, I did this on a Windows 10 machine).

This finally worked. RetroArch ripped each track to a separate .bin file. The CRC32 values matched the ones on redump. 

### Verifying the CRC32 

Linux users can do this with the 'crc32' CLI command. 

On Windows, the easiest way is with 7-zip. Open the 7-zip program and navigate to the file. Right click and choose CRC -> CRC32.

### Using it with the randomizer 

Go to sotn.io and choose the .bin file you created from Track 1 of the CD. You don't need any of the other tracks.

That's it. I'll race you to Galamoth.

(You'll probably win that race. I spend too much time farming for swords I never use.)
